On 9-23-2025 I experienced an Arch Linux Moment when I
tried logging into my awesomewm session, and it did not
load my config because an update to a library had removed a
deprecated feature that awesomewm relied on. Thankfully I
keep KDE Plasma installed on my system for exactly these
kinds of reasons, so I was still able to do my schoolwork for
the day. However, I felt irrationally uncomfortable
without my tiling and keyboard shortcuts, so I feel like
I should have a working sway config as a backup. So, that's
what this is.
